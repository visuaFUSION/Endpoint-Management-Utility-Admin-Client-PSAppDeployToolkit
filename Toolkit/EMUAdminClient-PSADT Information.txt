This Version of PSADT is based off of version 3.9.3 and has been slightly modified in the following ways:

- The Deploy-Application.ps1 script has been modified to include additional functions commonly utilized in 
"Application Shimming"/"Application Compatibility" troubleshooting activities.  These are found under the 
"# Start visuaFUSION Additional Provided Functions" and "# Start Community Additional Provided Functions" 
section.  The functions themselves are part of the previously utilized "Modular Application Packaging" 
concepts outlined by Sean Huggans on Bahusa.Net, but modified to utilize PSADT's logging functionality.

- The Deploy-Application.ps1 script has been modified to include several injection comments utilized by
the EMU Admin Client in "replace" functions.  This is how the EMU Admin Client is able to "fill the 
information out" and generate the installation script for you.
